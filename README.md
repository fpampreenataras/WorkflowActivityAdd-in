# Office Connector Extension

This project allows users to complete workflow activities and perform lifecycle promotes with in Office Word and Excel.  Other Office tools can be added.  There is a common toolbar that can be reused for other Office VSTO add-ins.  

## Project Details

#### Built Using:
Aras 11.0 SP9

#### Versions Tested:
Aras 11.0 SP9
Office Word and Excel 2016

## How It Works

This is an Office add-in that uses the custom properties **Aras Office Connector** populates.  Because it is not part of **Aras Office Connector** you will be prompted to login even if you have logged into the **Aras Office Connector**.  It assumes the document itself is not going through a workflow but that it's parent item is.  For example: if the document is attached to an ECR the add-in will move the ECR through the workflow.  However, if the document is part of a lifecycle than the user also has that ability.

There is a "Common" project that contains the Office ribbon and utilities to access Aras.  To add any additional Office products you will need to create a new VSTO project based on the desired Office product and then follow the Excel and Word projects as examples.  Be sure to add the "ThisRibbonCollection" class at the end to
